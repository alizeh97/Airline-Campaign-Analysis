# Airline-Campaign-Analysis

<h2>Overview:</h2>
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my data visualization and Predictive modeling project centered around Airline Campaign Analysis. The airline industry continually seeks innovative strategies to enhance customer loyalty and optimize marketing efforts. This project will delve into a dataset associated with a Canadian airline's Customer Loyalty Program. The dataset consists of data collected during a promotional campaign conducted between February and April 2018.
The primary objectives of this project are:
• Analyzing the impact of the promotional campaign on the enrollment and engagement levels within the loyalty program.
• Analyzing whether certain demographic segments of loyalty members exhibited more interest and engagement with the campaign.
• Assessing the campaign's influence on flight bookings for summer 2018.
